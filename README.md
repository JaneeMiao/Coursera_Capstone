# Coursera_Capstone
This is a new repository for Coursera capstone project.
## Week 1:
1. Create a new repository on your Github account and name it Coursera_Capstone.

  - Write some markdown to explain that this notebook will be mainly used for the capstone project.
  - Import the pandas library as pd.
  - Import the Numpy library as np.
  - Print the following the statement: Hello Capstone Project Course!

2. Push the Notebook to your Github repository and submit a link to the notebook on your Github repository.

## Week 3: Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information.. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so you need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas  dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.

Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

Your submission will be a link to your Jupyter Notebook on your Github repository.
